# four-leaf-clover-classification

This code trains a Resnet model on 64 pictures of 3 leaf and 4 leaf white clovers, with data augmentation being used to increase the training data. 

This is my first project, I found and cropped all of the pictures manually and took some of the 3 leaf pictures myself.
